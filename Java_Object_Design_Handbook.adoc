The lifecycle of an object

    1. Creating services
        1.1 Inject dependencies and configuration values as constructor arguments
            Keeping together configuration values that belong together
        1.2 Inject what you need, not where you can get it from
        1.3 All constructor arguments should be required
        1.4 Only use constructor injection
        1.5 There’s no such thing as an optional dependency
        1.6 Make all dependencies explicit
            Turn static dependencies into object dependencies
            Turn complicated functions into object dependencies
            Make system calls explicit
        1.7 Data relevant for the task should be passed as method arguments instead of constructor arguments
        1.8 Don’t allow the behavior of a service to change after it has been instantiated
        1.9 Do nothing inside a constructor, only assign properties
        1.10 Throw an exception when an argument is invalid
        1.11 Define services as an immutable object graph with only a few entry points
        1.12 Summary
    2. Creating other objects
        2.1 Require the minimum amount of data needed to behave consistently
        2.2 Require data that is meaningful
        2.3 Don’t use custom exception classes for invalid argument exceptions
        2.4 Extract new objects to prevent domain invariants from being verified in multiple places
        2.5 Extract new objects to represent composite values
        2.6 Use assertions to validate constructor arguments
        2.7 Don’t inject dependencies, optionally pass them as method arguments
        2.8 Use named constructors
            Create from primitive type values
            Don’t immediately add toString(), toInt(), etc.
            Introduce a domain-specific concept
            Optionally use the private constructor to enforce constraints
        2.9 Don’t use property fillers
        2.10 Don’t put anything more into an object than it needs
        2.11 Don’t test constructors
        2.12 The exception to the rule: Data transfer objects {#the-exception-to-the-rules:-data-transfer-objects}
            Use public properties
            Don’t throw exceptions, collect validation errors
            Use property fillers when needed
        2.13 Summary
    3. Manipulating objects
         
            Entities: identifiable objects which track changes and record events
            Value objects: replaceable, anonymous, and immutable values
            Data transfer objects: simple objects with fewer design rules
        3.1 Prefer immutable objects
            Replace values instead of modifying them
        3.2 A modifier on an immutable object should return a modified copy
        3.3 On a mutable object, modifier methods should be command methods
        3.4 On an immutable object, modifier methods should have declarative names
        3.5 Compare whole objects
        3.6 When comparing immutable objects, assert equality, not sameness
        3.7 Calling a modifier method should always result in a valid object
        3.8 A modifier method should verify that the requested state change is valid
        3.9 Use internally recorded events to verify changes on mutable objects
        3.10 Don’t implement fluent interfaces on mutable objects
        3.11 Summary

Using objects

    4. A template for implementing methods
        4.1 Pre-condition checks
        4.2 Failure scenarios
        4.3 Happy path
        4.4 Post-condition checks
        4.5 Return value
        4.6 Some rules for exceptions
            Use custom exception classes only if needed
            Naming invalid argument or logic exception classes
            Naming runtime exception classes
            Use named constructors to indicate reasons for failure
            Add detailed messages
        4.7 Summary
    5. Retrieving information
        5.1 Use query methods for information retrieval
        5.2 Query methods should have single-type return values
        5.3 Avoid query methods that expose internal state
        5.4 Define specific methods and return types for the queries you want to make
        5.5 Define an abstraction for queries that cross system boundaries
        5.6 Use stubs for test doubles with query methods
        5.7 Query methods should use other query methods, no command methods
        5.8 Summary
    6. Performing tasks
        6.1 Use command methods with a name in the imperative form
        6.2 Limit the scope of a command method, use events to perform secondary tasks
        6.3 Make services immutable from the outside as well as on the inside
        6.4 When something goes wrong, throw an exception
        6.5 Use queries to collect information, commands to take the next steps
        6.6 Define an abstraction for commands that cross system boundaries
        6.7 Only verify calls to command methods with a mock
        6.8 Summary
    7. Dividing responsibilities
        7.1 Separate write models from read models
        7.2 Create read models that are specific for their use cases
            Create read models directly from their data source
            Build read models from domain events
        7.3 Summary

Changing the behavior of objects

    8. Changing the behavior of services
        8.1 Introduce constructor arguments to make behavior configurable
        8.2 Introduce constructor arguments to make behavior replaceable
        8.3 Compose abstractions to achieve more complicated behavior
        8.4 Decorate existing behavior
        8.5 Use notification objects or event listeners for additional behavior
        8.6 Don’t use inheritance to change an object’s behavior
        8.7 Mark classes as final by default
        8.8 Mark methods and properties private by default
