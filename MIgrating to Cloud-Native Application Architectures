Rise of Cloud-Native
  What do these innovative companies have in common?
  • Speed of innovation
  • Always-available services
  • Web scale
  • Mobile-centric user experiences
  
 By cloud, we mean any computing environment in which computing, networking, 
 and storage resources can be provisioned and released elastically in an on-demand, 
 self-service manner.
 
 Why Cloud-Native Application Architectures?
 • Speed - Businesses that are able to innovate, experiment, and deliver software-based 
 solutions quickly are outcompeting those that follow more traditional delivery models.
 Why are frequent deployments impor tant? 
 If you can deploy hundreds of times per day, you can recover from mistakes almost instantly. 
 If you can recover from mistakes almost instantly, you can take on more risk. 
 If you can take on more risk, you can try wild experiments—the results might turn
 into your next competitive advantage.
 
 • Safety - Cloud-native application architectures balance the need to move rapidly with the
needs of stability, availability, and durability.
    So how do we go fast and safe?
      Visibility - We need the ability to measure everything, 
        establish a profile for “what’s normal,” detect deviations from the norm 
        (including absolute values and rate of change), 
        and identify the components contributing to those deviations.
     Fault isolation - Need to limit the scope of components or features that could be 
        affected by a failure.
     Fault tolerance - Prevent a failure in one of those components from 
        causing a cascading failure across its possibly many transitive dependencies.
     Automated recovery - With visibility, fault isolation, and fault tolerance, 
        we have the tools we need to identify failure, recover from failure, 
        and provide a reasonable level of service to our customers while we’re
        engaging in the process of identification and recovery.
